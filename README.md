# game_assignment
A project which is part of the assessment process, 
It's a game that creates a bunny who can eat carrots and run from the monsters by jumping and crossing them.

It heavily depends on Flame Engine which enables me to do the physics and movements of the main character, 
and flutter to struct the project and to be the entry point.
